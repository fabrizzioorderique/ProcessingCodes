This Sine Wave Visualizer Program is a simple learning tool to aid students in their understanding of sine wave manipulation. Written in Java using the Processing IDE, the easy-to-use UI permits students in any grade level to interact with a graphic display of a sine wave and experiment changing its features such as amplitude and period. The program focuses on 2 parts of the general sine equation, y = Asin(B(x+C))+D, ignoring the C and D variables. An explanation for this is offered below.

### Features
- Start/Stop animation button
- Amplitude Bar Manipulation
- Period of Wave Manipulation
- "Zoom in" feature for better visualization

### How to Use
- Clicking the start/stop button will enable the "dots" that make up the sine wave to move in normal oscillatory motion
- User can click and drag on the orange bar on the top of the screen to change the amplitude of the sine wave
- Using the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys allow the user to increase/decrease the period of the sine wave
- Using the UP and DOWN arrow keys scale the radius of the dots that make up the sine wave for more/less clutter on the screen

### My Purpose
These last 4 years of high school, I have dedicated a lot of my free time to one of my favorite activities: math tutoring. Working 100+ hours and volunteering 500+ hours as a tutor has taught me many things, among them is learning to adapt to each student's individual learning style. Furthermore, I picked up on key concepts that most students had difficulty understanding and made sure to reinforce those areas of teaching in later sessions.

One of these topics that many students had trouble with was understanding the "mysterious" and "abstract" sine graph. More specifically, many students had a hard time wrapping their heads around the foundational, general equation of a sine wave: y = Asin(B(x+C))+D. After learning what exactly was confusing students, I found that the problem was that students often mixed up how the variables A, B, C, and D change the graph. For example, some students would believe that the "A" in the equation would cause a vertical displacement or that changing "C" would change the period of the equation.

In order to correct this faulted way of thinking about the graph, I created this Sine Wave Visualizer Program by setting C and D equal to zero and allowing students to physically see the changes in the sine wave based on their alterations to A and B. By displaying the equation of the graph above the plane, students can see how changing the amplitude of the bar increases/decreases the "A" term and how increasing/decreasing the period is associated with the "B" term in the equation.

I have used this program on my current students and have found that not only does the program make it easier to grasp these sine wave manipulation concepts by dissecting it into manageable chunks, but the students often find entertainment when playing around with the program.

### Future Goals
The current goal is to continue making interactive programs for my students to use and focus on other areas that many learners need help with. With simple to use and manageable "applet-like" programs that focus only on certain aspects of a topic, these kid-friendly programs could potentially be used in learning centers and classrooms.
